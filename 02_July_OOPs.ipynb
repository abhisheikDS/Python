    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "-Inheritance in OOPs allows us to create new derived classes or subclasses based on base classes or superclasses.\n",
    "-The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class, and you can add or modify them to suit \n",
    "    the specific requirements of the derived class.\n",
    "-Here are some common use cases for inheritance:    \n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reuse: \n",
    " -Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes, avoiding duplication. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Specialization: \n",
    " -Inheritance enables you to create specialized versions of a base class by adding or overriding functionality. \n",
    " -Derived classes can inherit the common behavior from the base class while introducing additional features specific to their needs. \n",
    " -This allows for code specialization based on different use cases or requirements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Polymorphism: \n",
    " -Inheritance supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of \n",
    "  the common base class. \n",
    " -This enables writing code that can work with objects at a higher level of abstraction, improving flexibility and modularity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Extensibility:\n",
    " -When requirements change or new features need to be added, derived classes can be created to extend the behavior of \n",
    "  the base class without modifying its implementation.\n",
    " -This promotes flexibility and adaptability in response to evolving needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Organization:\n",
    " -It allows for creating a structured class hierarchy, where derived classes inherit from a base class and can themselves \n",
    "  serve as base classes for further specialization. \n",
    " -This hierarchical organization enhances code clarity, maintainability, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    " -Inheritance supports the concept of abstraction by allowing you to define abstract base classes. \n",

    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "    -Single inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit from only one base class. \n",
    "    -In single inheritance, a derived class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from a single base class (superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "1.Simplicity :\n",
    "    Single inheritance provides a simpler class hierarchy as there is a linear parent-child relationship between classes.\n",
    "2.Code Reusability: \n",
    "    Single inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing derived classes to inherit attributes and methods from a \n",
    "    single base class, avoiding code duplication.\n",
    "3.Encapsulation: \n",
